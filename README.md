BSHC---First-Year-Software-Project
==================================

This is a prototype application written in Java and built using the Netbeans IDE. The assignment was to create a functioning prototype for what would later be a mobile app to allow NCI students to gain better access to the in-house student support services department. I was part of a three-person project team and my role was to develop the Learning Support section of the application as well as the main interface. I have provided access to the full source code online. All code is commented on by the appropriate author.
